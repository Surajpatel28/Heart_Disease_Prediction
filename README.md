# Heart Disease Prediction

Predict the presence or absence of heart disease using logistic regression.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset `heart.csv` contains the following features:

- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (4 types)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl or <=120 mg/dl)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 types)
- **target**: Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease

## ⚙️ Model

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Task**: Binary classification (Heart Disease: Yes or No)
